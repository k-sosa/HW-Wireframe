# HW-Wireframe

This was the first homework assignemnt for web developing class and I had a hard time with the box model.
I did a lot of research on w3schools.com and got help from my classmates. I also did a tutoring session mid week to help me understand the concept of the box and nesting. 
To solve my issues, once I did more research and the tutor session, I used the dev tool on google to make corrections. I did not make all the corrections I wanted to because I kept messing other things up when correcting some, so for now I will leave it this way, but I learned a lot. And I know I would do it differently if I started over.
